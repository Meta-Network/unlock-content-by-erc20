        <ReactMarkdown>{`Thank you for using ERCBin! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using this Website. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented each major section of these terms with a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.

# A. Definitions

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the Agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
2. The “Service” or the “Pastbin Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by ERCBin, specifically excluding any User-Generated Content.
3. The “Website” refers to ERCBin’s website located at ERCBin, and all content, services, and products provided by ERCBin at or through the Website. It also refers to ERCBin-owned subdomains of ERCBin
4. “The User,” “you,” and “your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of your account; or that directs the use of your account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
5. “ERCBin,” “We,” and “Us” refer to ERCBin, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes the Service. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create, upload or own. For avoidance of doubt, “User-Generated Content” and “Your Content” are included in the definition of “Content.”

# B. Account Terms

**Short version:** *A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over to create an account; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while your account is being used. You are responsible for keeping your account secure and for any use of your account when it is accessed via your login credentials.*

**1. Required Information**
You must provide a valid email address, password & user name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity or other organization (in which case we need more information about the legal entity or organization) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

**2. Account Requirements**
We have a few simple rules for accounts on the ERCBin Service.

**▶** You must use Ethereum's wallet as the account.
**▶** You are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.

**3. User Account Security**
You are responsible for keeping your account secure.

**▶** You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
**▶** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account's private key. ERCBin cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
**▶** You will promptly notify ERCBin if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

# C. Acceptable Use

**Short version:** *While using the Service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on Content you may post, conduct while using the Website or Service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

**1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations**
Your use of the Website and the Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

 **▶** is or contains sexually obscene content;
 **▶** is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
 **▶** is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
 **▶** contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
 **▶** infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.


We reserve the right to reject or remove any Content we deem inappropriate, in our discretion, whether similar of dissimilar to the specific examples of unacceptable Content listed above.

**3. Conduct Restrictions**
While using the Website or the Service, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:

**▶** harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including ERCBin employees, officers, and agents, or other ERCBin Users;
**▶** use our servers for any form of excessive or automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, including but not limited to get-rich-quick schemes or other spam-like material;
**▶** attempt to disrupt or tamper with ERCBin's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on ERCBin's servers through automated means, or to access ERCBin's Service in ways that exceed your authorization
**▶** impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with ERCBin, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose;
**▶** violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent; or
**▶** violate any other provision of these Terms of Service or the Agreement, including redistributing or using Content for any purpose other than your own personal uses or internal business operations, specifically ***excluding\*** any creation of products or services to make available to others without our express prior written permission. For avoidance of doubt, any permission we may grant will in all cases exclude the ability to publish, redistribute, or otherwise make any Content available to third parties (as distinguished from a cybersecurity, anti-counterfeiting, other similar product or tool you may develop using Content but that does not itself result in redistribution of the Content) unless you have permission to do so directly from the User who posted the Content.

**4. Services Usage Limits**
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate or copy any portion of the Website or the Service, and not to sell, resell or exploit use of or access to the Website or the Service, without ERCBin's express prior written permission. Nor will you use any Content (other than Your Content) for any purpose other than your own personal or internal business, specifically excluding any creation of products or services to make available to others without our express prior written permission. For avoidance of doubt, any permission we may grant will in all cases exclude the ability to publish, redistribute, or otherwise make any Content available to third parties (as distinguished from a cybersecurity, anti-counterfeiting, other similar product or tool you may develop using Content but that does not itself result in redistribution of the Content) unless you have written permission to do so directly from the User who posted the Content.

**5. Display and Transfers**
You acknowledge that all use of the Website and Service is for your own personal or internal business purposes, specifically excluding any sharing, selling, or providing of Content, products or services to others without express written permission from us or the owner of the User Generated Content you wish to use. Without limiting the foregoing, without express written permission from the Owner of the Content, you may not (a) display to third parties and agree not to transfer or sell any Content (other than Your Content) to third parties, or (b) modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, sublicense, transfer, assign, rent, sell or otherwise convey any Content obtained from the Website or Service. For avoidance of doubt, any permission or rights we may grant will in all cases exclude the ability to publish, redistribute, or otherwise make any Content available to third parties (as distinguished from a cybersecurity, anti-counterfeiting, other similar product or tool you may develop using Content but that does not itself result in redistribution of the Content) unless you have written permission to do so directly from the User who posted the Content.

**6. Scraping**
Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. Scraping is strictly prohibited.

**7. Privacy**
Misuse of User Personal Information (as defined in the ERCBin Privacy Statement) is prohibited. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from ERCBin must comply with the ERCBin Privacy Statement, particularly in regard to the collection of our User Personal Information. If you collect any User Personal Information from the Website or the Service, you agree that you will only use such User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from the Website or the Service, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from ERCBin or ERCBin Users.

**8. Excessive Bandwidth Use**
If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other ERCBin customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you reduce your bandwidth consumption.

**9. User Protection**
You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

# D. User-Generated Content

**Short version:** *You own Content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the Content you post. You still have control over Your Content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those set forth in these Terms. We have the right to remove Content or close accounts if we need to, in our discretion.*

**1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content**
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the Content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Website or Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

**2. ERCBin May Remove Content**
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any ERCBin terms or policies or that we otherwise deem inappropriate in our discretion.

**3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants**
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create, upload or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

**4. License Grant to Us**
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to make the Website available and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users per these Terms, including to allow others to create private or commercial cyber-security, anti-counterfeiting and other products and services pursuant to these Terms (but not to redistribute or republish Your Content without your separate permission); and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

**5. License Grant to Other Users**
Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by others. By setting your pastes to be viewed publicly, you agree that you are allowing and authorizing other Users to not only to view your pastes, but you also are granting each User of the Website and the Service (as well as ERCBin itself) a nonexclusive, worldwide license to (a) use, display, and perform Your Content through the Website and the Service and to reproduce Your Content on the Website or through the Service as permitted or enabled through the Website’s or the Services functionality (for example, through cloning, embedding, or other similar tools offered on the Website), and (b) use such Content in studying and/or creating products and services of their own, but not to otherwise redistribute or republish Your Content outside of the Website or Service without your separate permission.

**6. Moral Rights**
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Sections D.4 and D.5, but not otherwise.

To the extent this Agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant ERCBin the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service consistent with these Terms of Service.

# E. Private Pastes

**Short version:** *You may have access to private pastes. We treat the content of private pastes as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security, antifraud, legal compliance, or other similar reasons.*

**1. Control of Private pastes.**
Some accounts, such as paid accounts, may have private pastes, which allow the User to control access to Content.

**2. Confidentiality of Private pastes.**
ERCBin considers the contents of private pastes to be confidential to you. ERCBin will protect the contents of private pastes from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. Please understand, however, that no security can guaranty against possible unauthorized disclosure or access, and no guarantee is made that private pastes may not become accessible to unauthorized third parties.

**3. Access.**
ERCBin employees may only access the content of your private pastes in the following situations:

**▶** With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If ERCBin accesses a private paste for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.
**▶** When access is required for security, antifraud, legal compliance, or other similar reasons.

You may choose to enable additional access to your private pastes. For example:

**▶** You may enable various Website services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private pastes. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but ERCBin will continue to treat your private paste Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those, we need to provide the ERCBin Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
**▶** You may also grant a third-party application authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your private pastes. Your use of third-party applications is at your sole risk; ERCBin is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access a private paste.

**4. Exclusions.**
If we have reason to believe the contents of a private paste are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private pastes.

# F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our Website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on the Website violates your rights, please contact us. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

# G. Disclaimer of Warranties

**Short version:** *We provide our Website and Service AS IS, and we make no promises or guarantees about either of them. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

ERCBin provides the Website and the Service “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service, including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Website or the Service.

# H. Limitation of Liability

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the Website or the Service or otherwise arising under this Agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

**▶** the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control. Some states do not allow exclusion of certain types of warranties or damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
***For New Jersey residents, the limitations set forth above are inapplicable where attorneys’ fees, court costs, or other damages are mandated by statute.\***

# I. Release and Indemnification

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release ERCBin from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that ERCBin (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases ERCBin of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

# J. Changes to These Terms

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — for example, we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So, while we may modify these Terms at any time, we will notify Users of changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to these Terms , such as price changes or other changes affecting User rights, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website and, in our discretion, via email using the contact information associated with any User account. You are responsible for keeping that contact information current so that we can reach you. We are not responsible for any failed or delayed notifications due to outdated or incorrect contact information you have provided to us. Your continued use of the Website or Service after the effective date of a change constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.



# K. Miscellaneous

**Short version:** *Our lawyers want us to include some additional standard terms as listed below.*

1. Links to Third-Party Sites
   The Website may contain hyperlinks to websites operated by others. Such hyperlinks are provided for your reference only. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or your use of them. Inclusion of hyperlinks does not imply any endorsement of the material on any other websites or any association with their operators.

2. Severability; Waiver.
   If any court finds any part of these Terms unenforceable, the rest will remain unaffected. No waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms is a waiver of any other breach of the same or any other provisions, and no waiver is effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of ERCBin.

4. Independent Contractors
